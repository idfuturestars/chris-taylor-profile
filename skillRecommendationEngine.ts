As an AI-powered skill recommendation engine for EiQ™ powered by SikatLab™ and IDFS Pathway™, analyze the following user profile and generate personalized skill recommendations:

User Profile:
- Current Skills: ${userProfile.currentSkills.join(", ")}
- Skill Levels: ${JSON.stringify(userProfile.skillLevels)}
- Learning Goals: ${userProfile.learningGoals.join(", ")}
- Educational Focus: ${userProfile.educationalFocus}
- Time Availability: ${userProfile.timeAvailability}
- Preferred Learning Style: ${userProfile.preferredLearningStyle}
- EiQ Score: ${userProfile.eiqScore}

Category Filter: ${category}

Generate 8-12 personalized skill recommendations that:
1. Align with their educational goals and current EiQ skill level
2. Fill identified skill gaps
3. Consider industry demand and future trends
4. Match their learning preferences and time availability
5. Provide clear learning paths and prerequisites

For each recommendation, provide:
- Skill name and category
- Priority level (critical/high/medium/low)
- Confidence score (0-100)
- Estimated time to complete
- Prerequisites
- Difficulty level
- Relevance score (0-100)
- Industry demand percentage
- Career impact percentage
- AI reasoning for the recommendation
- Related skills
- Learning resources

Focus on actionable, specific skills rather than broad categories. Consider both cognitive and emotional intelligence skills relevant to their educational development and EiQ improvement.

Return the response as a JSON array of skill recommendations.
