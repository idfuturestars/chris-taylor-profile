# Education-First Platform Transformation Report

## Summary
Successfully transformed EiQ™ powered by SikatLab™ and IDFS Pathway™ from a career-focused platform to an education-first learning ecosystem that prioritizes educational pathways with careers as secondary considerations for age-appropriate learners.
