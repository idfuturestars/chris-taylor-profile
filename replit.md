# EIQâ„¢ Powered by SikatLabsâ„¢ and IDFS Pathwayâ„¢ Educational Platform

## Overview
EIQâ„¢ Powered by SikatLabsâ„¢ and IDFS Pathwayâ„¢ is a comprehensive AI-driven educational intelligence platform featuring adaptive assessment algorithms that NEVER repeat questions for the same user. The system continuously generates new questions using AI/ML, adapts to individual learning styles through free-form responses, and integrates SAT/ACT/Myers Briggs/DSM/IQ/EQ assessment methodologies. The platform features a FICO-like EIQ scoring system (300-850 range) that predicts and improves users' learning capacity.

**Assessment Structure:**
- **Baseline Assessment:** 45 minutes, 60 questions across all 6 domains for quick initial EiQ score
- **Comprehensive Assessment:** 3h 45m, 260 questions for precise measurement and detailed analysis  
- **Targeted Practice:** 15-30 minutes, focused domain practice for score improvement

Built on Item Response Theory (IRT) with adaptive difficulty adjustment, the platform generates detailed EiQ scores with domain-specific breakdowns, improvement recommendations, and retesting encouragement. The focus is purely on intellectual measurement and score improvement, with AI analytics concentrating on identifying cognitive gaps and providing personalized enhancement strategies.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React 19 and TypeScript. It uses Shadcn/ui components, Radix UI primitives, and Tailwind CSS for styling. State management is handled by TanStack React Query, routing by Wouter, and authentication by JWT token-based authentication with localStorage persistence. Real-time features use WebSocket connections. The default design system features a dark theme with a green primary accent color.

### Backend Architecture
The server is built with Express.js and TypeScript (ES modules). It provides RESTful API endpoints, a WebSocket server for real-time features, JWT-based authentication with bcrypt for password hashing, and Multer for file uploads. Database integration is managed using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL.

### Data Storage Solutions
The application uses a PostgreSQL database, specifically Neon serverless PostgreSQL for scalability. Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database queries and schema management. The schema supports users, assessments, learning paths, documents, AI conversations, and study groups.

### Authentication and Authorization
The authentication system uses stateless JWT tokens for authentication, bcrypt for secure password storage, and client-side token storage. Middleware-based route protection is implemented for API endpoints. It supports Google OAuth and Apple Sign-In, with multi-provider account linking and secure JWT token management. Frontend authentication loop issues have been resolved with a circuit breaker pattern and proper handling of 401 responses.

### AI Integration Architecture
The platform features a multi-provider AI system using a broker pattern for seamless switching between OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and Vertex AI. It includes an automatic failover system and preserves user context and conversation history. The system supports real-time career guidance, user generation, and advanced analytics for career success and salary prediction. The Interactive Skill Recommendation Engine leverages AI to analyze user profiles, assessment data, and learning patterns to generate personalized skill recommendations with detailed learning paths, prerequisite tracking, and progress estimation. The system also includes an AI-powered mentoring system with multiple mentor personalities and real-time conversational guidance.

### System Design Choices
The platform incorporates IRT-based adaptive questioning with a 3-parameter logistic model and real-time adaptive difficulty adjustment. It includes an advanced voice-to-text assessment system with AI analysis, a 60-minute IDFS cognitive evaluation system, and an ML analytics engine for predictive modeling and behavioral pattern recognition. Real-time collaboration is supported via a WebSocket-based platform with live document editing, voice/video communication, and shared whiteboards. Comprehensive live user testing and behavioral analytics infrastructure is integrated for continuous improvement.
