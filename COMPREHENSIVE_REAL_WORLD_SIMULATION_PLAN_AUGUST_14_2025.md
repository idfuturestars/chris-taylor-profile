## PROBABILITY & STATISTICAL MODELS

### EIQ Score Distribution Model
```
Normal Distribution Parameters:
- Mean (μ): 500
- Standard Deviation (σ): 100
- Range: 300-850

Percentile Breakdowns:
- 50th percentile: 500 EIQ
- 75th percentile: 567 EIQ
- 90th percentile: 628 EIQ
- 95th percentile: 664 EIQ
- 99th percentile: 733 EIQ
```

### Titan Status Achievement Probabilities
Based on Item Response Theory (IRT) and educational assessment research:

**Probability Factors:**
1. **Initial Cognitive Ability** (40% weight)
2. **Learning Engagement** (25% weight) 
3. **Practice Consistency** (20% weight)
4. **Age-Appropriate Difficulty** (10% weight)
5. **Socioeconomic/Educational Context** (5% weight)

**Mathematical Model:**
```
P(Titan_Level_n) = Φ((θ - b_n) / a_n)

Where:
- θ = User's latent ability
- b_n = Difficulty threshold for level n
- a_n = Discrimination parameter
- Φ = Cumulative normal distribution
```
