Actually, checking the options, if y = 10: 2(10) - 5 = 15, not 5. Let me recalculate: x = 5, so 2y - 5 = 5, which gives 2y = 10, so y = 5. The answer should be 5, but that's not in the options. Let me check: if y = 10, then 2(10) - 5 = 15 ≠ 5. There seems to be an error in the question or options.",
