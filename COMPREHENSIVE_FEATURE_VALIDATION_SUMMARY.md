## 🔧 FEATURES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION (5/9)

### 1. **45-Minute Full Assessments** ❌
**Issue**: API routing problems causing HTML responses instead of JSON  
**Root Cause**: Assessment start endpoints not properly configured  
**Priority**: HIGH - Core functionality requirement  
**Fix Required**: API endpoint routing corrections

### 2. **15-Second Viral Challenges** ❌
**Issue**: Challenge API endpoints returning HTML instead of JSON  
**Root Cause**: Viral challenge routes not properly mounted  
**Priority**: HIGH - Social engagement feature  
**Fix Required**: Route registration and endpoint corrections

### 3. **Role-Model Matching & Path to X** ❌
**Issue**: Matching system API endpoints not responding correctly  
**Root Cause**: Role model routes configuration issues  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Enhancement feature  
**Fix Required**: API routing and data model corrections

### 4. **Performance Requirements (Sub-500ms, 10M Concurrent)** ❌
**Issue**: Performance testing framework needs refinement  
**Root Cause**: Concurrent testing methodology limitations  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Scale validation requirement  
**Fix Required**: Enhanced load testing implementation

### 5. **Adaptive Engine Question Uniqueness** ❌
**Issue**: Adaptive session endpoints not properly configured  
**Root Cause**: API route mounting and session management  
**Priority**: HIGH - Core assessment feature  
**Fix Required**: Adaptive engine API corrections

---

## 🎯 TECHNICAL ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Primary Issue: API Routing Configuration
**Problem**: Multiple API endpoints returning HTML (DOCTYPE errors) instead of JSON  
**Impact**: 5/9 feature validations failed due to incorrect API responses  
**Solution**: Route mounting and endpoint configuration corrections  

**Specific Endpoints Affected**:
- `/api/viral-challenge/start` - Viral challenges
- `/api/adaptive/start-session` - Adaptive assessments  
- `/api/role-models/search` - Role model matching
- `/api/assessment/start` - Full assessments

**Technical Fix Applied**:
- Added proper error handling for route imports
- Fixed viral challenge route mounting (`/api/viral-challenge/` vs `/api/viral/`)
- Added adaptive assessment endpoints with proper authentication
- Enhanced route registration logging for debugging
